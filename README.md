# NPL-project
Real or Fake news? No worries â€” our Natural Language Processing (NLP) model will decide for you!
We developed a robust text classification model capable of distinguishing between real and fake news articles, leveraging advanced NLP techniques

# About the Project
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for fake news detection. Using NLP methods and classification algorithms, we trained and evaluated a model that can analyze news articles and predict their authenticity with high accuracy.
# Features
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming, lemmatazing, vectorization.
- Model training: leveraging algorithms such as super vector machine, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest.
- Experimentation with embedding-based and TF-IDF-based models ((using Word2Vec and GloVe)
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2.
# Dataset
We have been provided two datasets: one labeled dataset (training_data_lowercase.csv) with real and fake news headlines for training and evaluation, and a second unlabeled dataset (testing_data_lowercase_nolabels.csv) for generating predictions and testing the model in real-world scenarios.
